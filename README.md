# Bubble Sort in Assembly Language
This is a simple implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in assembly language for the x86 architecture.
# Description
This program prompts the user to enter 10 values, then sorts them in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. Finally, it displays the sorted array on the screen.
# Code Organization
The code is organized into the following sections:
# Data:
Defines the program's data, including the prompt strings and the array to be sorted.
# Code:
Contains the program's logic, including the input loop, the bubble sort algorithm, and the output loop.
3 How to Run
To run this program, you will need an assembler (such as MASM or TASM) and a DOS emulator (such as DOSBox). Assemble the program using the assembler, then run the resulting executable file in the DOS emulator.
